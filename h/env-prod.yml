  # Based on constant-load testing against the badge endpoint (which forms our
  # baseline load as of 2017-06-26), a single m4.large instance will begin to
  # suffer latency degradations as request rates approach 60 req/s,
  # corresponding to outbound traffic to the internet of about 65kBps.
  #
  # Using a margin of safety, let's call this 50kBps. Multiplying this up by
  # the 5 minute accumulation period, this gives a scale-out threshold of about
  # 15e6 bytes per-instance over that period.

  # Similar constant-load testing shows that a single m4.large instance will
  # happily serve 30 req/s (and ~32kBps to the internet) constantly, with
  # relatively low utilisation. This gives us a scale in threshold of:
  #
  #     32kBps * 5 min = 9.6e6 bytes
  #
  # BUT it is important that the scale-in threshold is less than 1/2 of the
  # scale-out threshold (UpperThreshold) by some margin, otherwise overall
  # traffic levels corresponding to ~UpperThreshold will result in constant
  # scaling activity with the cluster switching between 1 and 2 instances
  # forever.
  #
  # As such, we pick roughly 0.9 * (UpperThreshold / 2) as the value for the
  # LowerThreshold.
